## Context and Problem Statement

Currently, updates to a plugin are instantly propagated through the entire landscape of a customer.
While E2E and plugin-specific tests increase transparency and worst case trigger rollbacks, a user-configurable, staged deployment is required for risk mitigation.
Discuss a pragmatic approach and define a POC.

**Discussion:**

- Plugin on the greenhouse-extensions.git main branch must be production ready
- Get inspiration from Gardener to inform customer "Upcoming changes in plugin ..." with a grace period. Force upgrade afterwards.
- Classify cluster
- Stable API with migration paths
- Follow engineering policy: Bronze, Silver, Gold with grace period in between.
- Configurable terms for stages; configurable time between stages with greenhouse-enforced maximum.
- Emergency fixes should be possible
- How to handle failed upgrades: rollback vs forward fix (tendency: forward fix)

**Goal:**

- Introduce a concept of tiers for clusters, to stage rollouts of Plugins
- Introduce a Plugin Lifecycle Policy
