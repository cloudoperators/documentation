## Context and Problem Statement

Define which functionalities rely on labels and which labels these are. This should be done for the entire stack (e.g. Metrics, Logs, Alerts, Playbooks, Plutono, UIs[Supernova, ...] ...)
This also includes indentifying mandatory labels (e.g. owner-info etc.), which are used for alert routing... 

The goal of this ADR is to define a common set of labels that can be used across all components of the greenhouse stack. These labels should then also be enforced, defaulted and integrated across Greenhouse.

## Decision Drivers <!-- optional -->

- [driver 1, e.g., a force, facing concern, …]
- [driver 2, e.g., a force, facing concern, …]
- … <!-- numbers of drivers can vary -->

## Considered Options

- [option 1]
- [option 2]
- [option 3]
- … <!-- numbers of options can vary -->

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "[option 1]",
because [justification. e.g., only option, which meets k.o. criterion decision driver | which resolves force force | … | comes out best (see below)].
