## Context and Problem Statement

- Define Greenhouse core version and release mechanism; Plugins are a different topic
- All together or different version allowed
- Discuss improvements to our versioned release mechanism (currently very cumbersome for Greenhouse MFEs)
- E2E/Smoke tests, automation to create and publish release (make, GH workflow) + documentation

**Discussion:**

- For GH deployment version bumping in various places required. Very cumbersome.
- Workaround tagging on `latest` is being used.
- Single source of truth for versions
- One version for GH core with plugin versions compatbility matrix
- Follow Kubernetes release principles. Version CRDs and treat as API contracts
- Automate version upgrades (dependabot, renovate)
- Consider draft releases
